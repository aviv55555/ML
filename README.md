<h1>Machine_Learning_Final_Project</h1>
<p>
For our final project, my partner and I took on the intriguing task of building a machine learning model to classify survivors of the Titanic disaster. Our dataset contained diverse examples of Titanic passengers, and our goal was to predict whether each passenger survived. We carefully prepared separate training and test sets, then trained our model and rigorously evaluated its performance. This project was highly meaningful for us, as it allowed us to explore and apply various machine learning techniques.
